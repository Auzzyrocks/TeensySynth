The .stl files in this project were created by Austin Shouli and are freely available for download and use. 

The case was CNC cut from 1/4" plywood and should press fit together, pssobily with a little sanding. 

The switch mounting plates are designed to snap fit a standard MX keyboard switch, and then bolt to the faceplate. 

The latest software revision is available on this repo: Teensy_Synth_Rev_9.ino. The pinouts can be found in this file.
